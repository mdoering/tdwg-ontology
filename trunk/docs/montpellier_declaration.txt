Montpellier Taxonomy  Declaration
****************************************

We intend to promote the sharing of taxonomic data (lists of names and taxa) by attempting to publish them in a unified way.

Publishing a classification or taxonomic checklist on the web involves some or all of the following components

* Lists of taxa in text files in accordance with the DwC archive format.
* HTTP URIs for taxa that are "Linked Data" compliant and return RDF using an agreed vocabulary.
* Inclusion of standardised HTTP URI for shared taxon names e.g. from nomenclators
* Links to other classifications also published on the web.

How publication is achieved for any one dataset will depend on the abilities of the data provider.

Various resources are needed to make progress.

* A set of guidelines or best practice documentation
* Validation services to check that published data meets the guidelines.
* Promotional material (docs, talks, challenges) to encourage the exploitation of published taxonomies.

We will cooperate in creating these resources.

Things that it would be nice to happen before the next TDWG meeting and that we will attempt to achieve are:

* Drupal plug-in to help the Drupal powered systems (Scratchpads, Lifedesks etc) meet the guidelines.
* Adaption of the CDM or CDM portal component to meet the guidelines.
* Adaption of the IPT to meet the guidelines.
